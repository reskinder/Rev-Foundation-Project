## NOTE: TRY USING LIST COMPREHENSION TO GET SPECIFIC SHELVES FROM GOODREADS CSV FILE
## NOTE: IF VALUE IS NULL, IT WILL PRINT AS 'None' IN PYTHON TERMINAL

## Project Plan: Personal Library Like Goodreads
- Database will be made at beginning of code, so CRUD operations only done on tables & records
- Database will have 5 permanent tables: 
    - Ebook, Physical (primary keys)
    - Read, Currently Reading, Want To Read (foreign keys)
- Database --> Library
  Table    --> Shelf
  Record   --> Book
- Note: can have multiple foreign keys & make them default to blank ("")

- What I Want
    - User has personal library full of books they have read, are currently reading, and want to read
    - Ask user if they want to add new books by importing csv file, or manually (try & make it so you can add multiple books)
        - NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT DUPLICATES CANNOT BE MADE REGARDLESS OF CSV OR MANUAL INPUT
    - CSV IMPORT STEPS (Steps for adding new books from csv file to library):

    - MANUALLY ADDING STEPS (Steps for adding a new book to library)
        1. Ask user if it's an ebook or physical book
        2. Ask user if it's a book they've read, are currently reading, or want to read
        3. If its a book they've read
            - Ask for the date they finished reading it (if they don't remember, leave blank)
            - Ask for rating (1 - 5)
            - Ask for review (if they don't want to leave a review, leave null)

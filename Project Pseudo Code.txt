## PROJECT PSEUDO CODE
Project Goal: Make a crude version of Goodreads w/ tables: ebook, physical, read, currently reading, want to read

## NOTE: TRY USING LIST COMPREHENSION TO GET SPECIFIC SHELVES FROM GOODREADS CSV FILE
## NOTE: IF VALUE IS NULL, IT WILL PRINT AS 'None' IN PYTHON TERMINAL

## Project Plan: Personal Library Like Goodreads
- Database will be made at beginning of code, so CRUD operations only done on tables & records
- Database will have 5 permanent tables: 
    - Ebook, Physical (primary keys)
    - Read, Currently Reading, Want To Read (foreign keys)
- Database --> Library
  Table    --> Shelf
  Record   --> Book
- Note: can have multiple foreign keys & make them default to blank ("")

- What I Want
    - User has personal library full of books they have read, are currently reading, and want to read
    - Ask user if they want to add new books by importing csv file, or manually
        - NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT DUPLICATES CANNOT BE MADE REGARDLESS OF CSV OR MANUAL INPUT
    - CSV IMPORT STEPS
        1. 

    - MANUALLY ADDING BOOK STEPS
        1. Ask user for title, author, publish date, & genre (can be multiple)
        2. Ask user if it's an ebook or physical book
            - If ebook, ask for ASIN; if physical, ask for ISBN
        3. Ask user if it's a book they've read, are currently reading, or want to read
            - If its a book they've read
                - Ask for the date they finished reading it (if they don't remember, leave blank)
                - Ask for rating (1 - 5)
                - Ask for review (if they don't want to leave a review, leave null)

## From written notes
# MAIN LIBRARY MENU
- Select a shelf (first 5 shelves are permanent & cannot be deleted):
1. Ebooks               --- # of books
2. Physical             --- # of books
3. Read                 --- # of books
4. Currently Reading    --- # of books
5. Want To Read         --- # of books
6. Create Your Own Custom Shelf
    - If user creates more shelves, list them out in menu & make them deletable

-- After user selects a shelf, take them to that shelf's menu
# BASIC SHELF MENU

## NOTE: Possibly make a parent 'Shelf' class for all things in common
    - Title, Series, Author, Publish Date
